# Telco Classification Project

## Purpose
This repository holds all resources used in the attainment of the goals established for the Telco Classification Project.

## Goals
1. Answer the research question: Why are our customers churning?
2. Create a model to predict churn for each customer.
3. Create a summary [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hjDQED2eNU-k_RryLbJG70J1u-wI8Lm08Jd-mGUlmBM/edit?usp=sharing) describing the drivers of churn.

## Instructions for Cloning
- All files necessary for the replication of the analysis in master_project_pipeline.ipynb are contained within this repository.

## Need to Haves
1. A report in the form of a jupyter notebook
2. A .csv file that predicts churn for each customer using our best model
3. Python scripts for replicability
    - acquire.py
    - prepare.py
    - model.py
4. A presentation in the form of [Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hjDQED2eNU-k_RryLbJG70J1u-wI8Lm08Jd-mGUlmBM/edit?usp=sharing)

## Nice to Haves
